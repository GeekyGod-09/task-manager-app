Project Plan Overview
Project Name
Task/Project Management Tool

Project Purpose
To build a web-based application that enables collaborative project and task management, featuring role-based permissions, Kanban board UI, real-time updates, and notifications. The tool will help teams organize work, assign tasks, track progress, and communicate efficiently.

Project Goals & Objectives
Enable project leaders to create and manage projects.

Allow project leaders to assign tasks and set deadlines for team members.

Let team members update task status, comment, and collaborate.

Support real-time updates and notifications for assignments and deadlines.

Provide a visual Kanban board for workflow management.

Ensure secure authentication and role-based access.

Success Criteria
All core features are functional and tested (project creation, task assignment, Kanban board, notifications).

The application is accessible and responsive across devices.

At least one real project can be managed end-to-end using the tool.

Documentation is complete and up-to-date.

The project is delivered on time and within the planned scope.

Scope
In Scope: User authentication, project and task CRUD, Kanban board, real-time updates, notifications, comments, file attachments, role management.

Out of Scope: Advanced analytics, integrations with third-party tools, mobile app (for initial version).

Key Deliverables
Functional web application (frontend and backend)

Database schema and API documentation

User and developer documentation

Deployment scripts and instructions

Roles & Responsibilities
Project Leader: Planning, design, task assignment, code reviews

Developer(s): Feature implementation, testing, documentation

Tester(s): Manual and automated testing, bug reporting

Risks & Mitigation
Scope creep: Stick to MVP features for first release

Delays: Use a Kanban board and regular check-ins to track progress

Technical blockers: Break down tasks, seek help early, and document issues

Tracking & Reporting
Use GitHub Projects for Kanban-style tracking of issues and features.

Weekly reviews to monitor progress and adjust as needed.
